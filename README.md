# Machine-Learning + Computer Vision

Learning Computer Vision & Machine Learning with Python/OpenCV and foraying into some Deep Learning as well with TensorFlow. I am developing a smart pan-tilt mechanism with the following functionality:

- Detecting coloured object
- Arduino and RaspberryPi communication with PID control
- Track coloured object
- Deploy image classification TF model on Pi
- Integrate all these to create a cute soft-toy security camera
